Your task is to generate ${count} highly relevant content topics that:

1. Are directly inspired by recent content trends and discussions from the provided research insights
2. Are fully aligned with the expert's positioning, voice tone, audience, and strategic goals
3. Are optimized for the social media platforms the expert uses
4. Help the expert bring fresh, relevant conversations into their content, positioning them as a thought leader
5. Offer actionable insights, valuable perspectives, or practical advice that resonate with the expert's audience

For each topic, provide:
- A concise title (5-8 words)
- A brief description (1-2 sentences explaining the topic's focus)
- A content category (e.g., Thought Leadership, Educational, Trend Analysis, Opinion, Case Study)
- 3-5 relevant tags for discoverability and organization
- Source reference: indicate which part of the research insights inspired this topic
- 5 strategic viewpoints (angles the expert could take). For each viewpoint:
  - A title (3-6 words)
  - A brief description (1 sentence)

Ensure each suggestion is deeply connected to the recent content landscape, but always filtered through the lens of the expert's goals and brand. Strive for diversity in content formats or approaches where relevant (e.g., tutorial, opinion post, trend analysis, or storytelling).
