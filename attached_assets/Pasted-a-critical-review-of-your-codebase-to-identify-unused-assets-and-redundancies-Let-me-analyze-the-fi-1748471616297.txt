a critical review of your codebase to identify unused assets and redundancies. Let me analyze the files and dependencies systematically.

Critical Code Redundancy Issues
1. Multiple Anthropic Service Files (HIGH PRIORITY)
You have 4 different Anthropic service implementations:

server/anthropic.ts (original, likely unused)
server/anthropic-clean.ts (clean implementation)
server/anthropic-final.ts (final implementation)
server/anthropic-fixed.ts (fixed implementation)
Currently using: server/anthropic-fixed.ts (imported in routes.ts)

2. Duplicate Perplexity Services
server/services/perplexity-master.ts (duplicate of master-perplexity-clean.ts)
server/services/master-perplexity-clean.ts (actively used)
server/perplexity.ts (root level, likely redundant)
3. Duplicate Research Cache Services
server/services/research-cache.ts (old implementation)
server/services/research-cache-clean.ts (clean implementation, actively used)
4. Legacy Content Pipeline
server/content-pipeline.ts (legacy scraping-based)
server/content-pipeline-v2.ts (new Perplexity-based)
Unused Dependencies in package.json
Development Dependencies (Safe to Remove)
@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer: Not used in vite.config.ts
@tailwindcss/typography: Not used in tailwind config
@types/connect-pg-simple: Session storage not implemented
@types/passport*: Authentication not using Passport
@types/ws: WebSocket not implemented
Production Dependencies (Safe to Remove)
cheerio: Used only in removed scraping system
connect-pg-simple: Session storage not implemented
express-session: Session storage not implemented
memorystore: Session storage not implemented
passport*: Authentication using Replit auth instead
ws: WebSocket functionality not implemented
crypto: Using Node.js built-in instead
react-icons: Using Lucide React icons instead
wouter: Using simple routing, not this library
Unused UI Components (Safe to Remove)
Many Radix UI components in client/src/components/ui/ are unused:

alert.tsx
chart.tsx
navigation-menu.tsx (partially used)
skeleton.tsx
toast.tsx / toaster.tsx (hook exists but components unused)
Files Safe to Remove
Server Files
server/anthropic.ts
server/anthropic-clean.ts
server/anthropic-final.ts
server/content-pipeline.ts
server/services/perplexity-master.ts
server/services/research-cache.ts
server/perplexity.ts (root level)
server/services/smart-research.ts (appears unused)
server/research-routes.ts (not registered in main routes)
server/intelligent-cache.ts (superseded by research-cache-clean)
Test Files (If not actively testing)
tests/ directory (7 test files that may not be current)
Archive Directory
archive/ directory (contains old pasted code snippets)
attached_assets/ directory (PDF files and pasted content)
Directory Structure After Cleanup
The cleaned structure would look like:

│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── master-perplexity-clean.ts ✓
