Execution Plan for Web Scraping + RAG Content System
Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement
First, we need to add tables for scraped content storage:

shared/schema.ts
Add scraped content tables, Add schema types for scraped content
Phase 2: Web Scraping Service
Create a robust scraping service with proper error handling and rate limiting:

server/scraping.ts
Create web scraping service
Phase 3: Enhanced Storage Methods
Add storage methods for scraped content:

server/storage.ts
Add scraped content storage methods, Add scraped content interface methods, Implement scraped content storage methods, Add missing imports for database operations
Phase 4: Enhanced Anthropic Service with RAG
Modify the Anthropic service to use scraped content as context:

server/anthropic.ts
Add RAG capability to content generation
Phase 5: API Routes for Scraping
Add routes to trigger and manage scraping:

server/routes.ts
Add scraping API routes
Phase 6: Missing Database Imports
Fix missing imports in storage.ts:

Phase 7: Database Migration
Create migration for new tables:

npx drizzle-kit generate
Critical Analysis & Safety Considerations
✅ Safety Measures Implemented:
Rate Limiting: 2-second delays between requests to respect server resources
Timeout Protection: 30-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
Content Size Limits: Maximum 50KB per scraped content to prevent storage issues
Duplicate Prevention: Content hashing to avoid storing duplicate articles
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
Recent Content Filter: Only processes content from last 7 days
Relevance Scoring: Filters content based on expert's keywords
✅ Proper RAG Implementation:
Context Retrieval: Gets recent, relevant content based on expert's expertise
Relevance Ranking: Uses keyword matching and scoring algorithm
Context Integration: Passes scraped content as context to Anthropic API
Content Freshness: Filters for content published/scraped within 7 days
Limited Context: Uses only top 5 most relevant articles to avoid token limits
✅ No Harm to Existing Features:
Backward Compatibility: All existing APIs remain unchanged
Optional Integration: RAG context is only added when expertId is provided
Incremental Enhancement: New tables don't affect existing schema
Background Processing: Scraping runs asynchronously to avoid blocking UI
Graceful Degradation: If no scraped content exists, system works as before
⚠️ Production Considerations:
Legal Compliance: Ensure you have rights to scrape target websites
robots.txt Respect: Consider checking robots.txt before scraping
Rate Limiting: Current 2-second delay may need adjustment per site
Content Licensing: Be aware of content licensing and fair use policies
Resource Monitoring: Monitor database growth and implement cleanup policies
This implementation provides a robust, safe, and properly architected RAG system that enhances content generation without breaking existing functionality.
